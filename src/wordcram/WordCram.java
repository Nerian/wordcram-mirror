/**
 * The WordCram class is the main API for WordCram.  There are three steps to making a WordCram:
 * <ol>
 * <li>weight your words
 * <li>style your words
 * <li>draw your WordCram
 * </ol>
 * You start with a <code>new WordCram(this)</code>, and then...
 * 
 * <h2>Step One: Weight Your Words</h2>
 * 
 * You start by giving WordCram either some text to chew on,
 * or an array of Words you've weighted yourself.
 * 
 * <h3>Let WordCram Weight Your Words</h3>
 * <p>
 * WordCram can weight your words by the number of times they appear in a text document.  
 * It can load text from a few different sources:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #fromWebPage(String)} will load a URL (or an HTML file from the filesystem), and scrape the text from the HTML</li>
 * <li>{@link #fromTextFile(String)} will load a file (from the filesystem or the network), and treat it as plaintext</li>
 * <li>{@link #fromHtmlString(String)} takes a String, assumes it's HTML, and scrapes out its text</li>
 * <li>{@link #fromTextString(String)} takes a String, and assumes it's plaintext</li>
 * <li>If you need some other way to load your text, 
 * 	    pass your own TextSource to {@link #fromText(TextSource)}, 
 * 	    and WordCram will get its text via {@link TextSource#getText()}.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * Once the text is loaded, you can control how WordCram counts up the words.
 * <p>
 * <b>Case sensitivity:</b>  If your text contains "hello", "HELLO", and "Hello",
 * <ul><li>{@link #lowerCase()} will count them all as "hello"</li>
 * 	   <li>{@link #upperCase()} will count them all as "HELLO"</li>
 *     <li>{@link #keepCase()}, the default, will count them separately, as three different words</li></ul>
 * <p>
 * <b>Numbers:</b>
 * If your text contains words like "42" or "3.14159", 
 * you can remove them with {@link #excludeNumbers()} (the default),
 * or include them with {@link #includeNumbers()}.
 * <p>
 * <b>Stop words:</b> <a href="../constant-values.html#wordcram.text.StopWords.ENGLISH">Common English words</a>
 * are removed from the text by default, but you can use your own list of stop words
 * with {@link #withStopWords(String)}.
 * 
 * 
 * <h3>Weight Your Own Words</h3>
 * If you have some other way to weight your words, you can pass them to {@link #fromWords(Word[])}.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * <h2>Step Two: Style Your Words</h2>
 * 
 * There are six questions you have to answer when drawing a word on the WordCram:
 * 
 * <h3>How big should it be?</h3>
 * A word can be 
 * {@link #sizedByWeight(int, int)},
 * {@link #sizedByRank(int, int)}, or
 * {@link #withSizer(WordSizer)}
 * 
 * <h3>How should it be angled?</h3>
 * It can be 
 * {@link #angledAt(float...)},
 * {@link #angledBetween(float, float)}, or
 * {@link #withAngler(WordAngler)}
 * 
 * <h3>What font should it be in?</h3>
 * {@link #withFont(String)}
 * {@link #withFonts(String...)}
 * {@link #withFonter(WordFonter)}
 * 
 * <h3>How should it be colored?</h3>
 * {@link #withColors(int...)}
 * {@link #withColorer(WordColorer)}
 * 
 * <h3>Where on the image should it go?</h3>
 * {@link #withPlacer(WordPlacer)}
 * 
 * <h3>If it doesn't fit at first, how should I nudge it?</h3>
 * {@link #withNudger(WordNudger)}
 * 
 * 
 * <h2>Step Three: Draw Your WordCram</h2>
 * 
 * <p>After all that, actually rendering the WordCram is simple.
 * 
 * You can repeatedly call {@link #drawNext()} while the WordCram {@link #hasMore()} words
 * to draw (probably once per Processing frame):
 * <pre>
 * void draw() {
 *     if (wordCram.hasMore()) {
 *         wordCram.drawNext();
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * Or you can call {@link #drawAll()} once, and let it loop for you:
 * <pre>
 * void draw() {
 *     wordCram.drawAll();
 * }
 * </pre>
