WordCram is a <a href="http://processing.org">Processing</a> library for generating word clouds.
Like this one, made from the text on 
<a href="http://wordcram.wordpress.com">http://wordcram.wordpress.com</a>:
<p>

<p>
It loads text from files and web addresses, can handle HTML, and does some basic text analysis, counting
up the words.  You choose each word's font, color, size, and rotation.
<p>
To get started, check out the javadoc for <a href="wordcram/WordCram.html">WordCram</a> -- that should
explain how things fit together.  From there, you might want to look at the 
<a href="wordcram/Anglers.html">Anglers</a>,
<a href="wordcram/Colorers.html">Colorers</a>,
<a href="wordcram/Sizers.html">Sizers</a>,
<a href="wordcram/Placers.html">Placers</a>,
and the oddly-named <a href="wordcram/Fonters.html">Fonters</a> to see what options are provided 
out-of-the-box.
<p>
Read the wiki, report an issue, download the bytes, or <code>svn checkout</code> the source at 
the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/wordcram/">project page</a>; see what's new at 
the <a href="http://wordcram.wordpress.com">blog</a>, or

WordCram was inspired by <a href="http://wordle.net">Wordle</a>.
