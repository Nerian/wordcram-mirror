It loads text from files and web addresses, can handle HTML, and does some basic text analysis, counting
up the words.  You choose each word's font, color, size, and rotation.

You can learn more about WordCram from its <a href="http://code.google.com/p/wordcram/">project page</a>,

WordCram was inspired by <a href="http://wordle.net">Wordle</a>.
