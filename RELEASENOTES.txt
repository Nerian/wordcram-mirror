Release notes for WordCram 0.3:

* Added TextSource, so WordCram can count words from different kinds
  of source, including web pages and text files.
* Added a fluent API for building WordCrams: 
  new WordCram(this).forWebPage("{url}").sizedByWeight(10, 100).
* Added case-sensitive word counting, and the ability to exclude
  numeric words.
* Added javadoc comments for lots of classes -- more to come.
* Added Processing examples: in Processing, look under File >
  Sketchbook > libraries > WordCram > examples.
* Bug fix: issue 1, Stop-words with punctuation have no effect.
* Added StopWords.JAVA for making WordCrams from java source code.
* Added Anglers.heaped(), Anglers.randomBetween(min,max),
  Colorers.twoHuesRandomSatsOnWhite(), and
  Placers.horizBandAnchoredLeft().
* Deprecated old WordCram constructors, WordCram.currentWord(), and
  WordCram.currentWordIndex().
* Changed minimum shape size from 4 to 7, to speed up rendering.
* WaveWordPlacer and SwirlWordPlacer no longer randomly offset
  placement, so they should look crisper.
* Improved SpiralWordNudger's spiralling, so more words should show,
  and faster.
