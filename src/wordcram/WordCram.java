/**
 * WordCram is the main API for WordCram.  There are two phases to using a WordCram: 
 * constructing, and drawing.
 * 
 * <p>Constructing a WordCram is done with the fluent API -- first, construct a WordCram,
 * then call configuring methods on it.  Like this:
 * <pre>
 * WordCram wc = new WordCram(this)                            // Construct the WordCram...
 *   .fromWords(new WebPage("http://wordcram.wordpress.com"))  // set its words... 
 *   .withFonts("serif")                                       // set its font...
 *   .withColors(color(255,0,0), color(0,0,255));              // set its colors.
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>Creating a WordCram comes down to two parts:
 * <ul>
 * 	 <li>Give it your text or word list.  All these methods start with "from...": 
 * 		 {@link #fromWebPage(String)}, {@link #fromTextFile(String)}, {@link #fromWords(Word[])}, etc.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>Tell it how to display your words.  All these methods start with "with...": 
 *       {@link #withFonts(PFont...)}, {@link #withColors(int...)}, etc.
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>After all that, actually rendering the WordCram is simple.  There are two ways:
 * <ul>
 * 	 <li>repeatedly call {@link #drawNext()} while the WordCram {@link #hasMore()} words
 *       to draw (probably once per Processing frame):
 *       <pre>
 *       void draw() {
 *           if (wordCram.hasMore()) {
 *               wordCram.drawNext();
 *           }
 *       }
 *       </pre>
 *   </li>
 *   <li>call {@link #drawAll()} once, and let it loop for you:
 *       <pre>
 *       void draw() {
 *           wordCram.drawAll();
 *       }
 *       </pre>
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
